# User-Management-App

## Overview
This project is a simple User-Management-App which gets random photos from the RandomUser.me API key, and gets all the details with it which you can view once you click the "Details" button.

### Technology Stack

- **HTML (index.html & details.html)**

- **JavaScript**

### Functionality (JavaScript)
This project incorporates several JavaScript functions, below are the many key functions needed for this project to work: 

- **fetchUser() - Takes 10 random people from the API and displays the photo aswell as the details and puts them into the details.html portion of the website.**

- **navigateToDetails() - This takes you to the details page of the person when you click the 'Details' button.**

- **loadUserDetails() - Reloads the entire page and then once reloaded it will load all of the user details.**

# Styling and Layout
There is not styling or layout in this webpage, everthing is on Bootstrap.

### Project Structure
These are all the files I used and why I used them.

- **index.html - Has the navbar and the container for all of the users as well as all the button id's and the images.**

- **details.html - The page after you click on the details button for that specific person.**

- **script.js - Has all of the functions needed to get this page up and running.**
